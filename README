Drawmore is a canvas painting app
http://drawmore.net

Drawing oekaki-style for fun times.
Experimenting with UI and workflow.

Very shortcut-centric.

Zero-dialog idea & kb shortcuts cribbed from MyPaint.
Brush resize after Blender's sculpt tool.


Goals:
1) Efficient drawing workflow
  - From an empty canvas to picture posted on the web
